			tini.si is a URL shortener service. It is a free and open source project. That's literally it.
			Why is it called tini.si? Because it's tiny. And it's a .si domain. Get it? It's a pun. It's a
			good pun. It's a great pun. It's a pun that's so good, it's tini. It's tini.si. It's a great
			pun. It's a great domain. It's a great service. It's a great project. It's tini.si. You are
			the only tin-i-si. Copilot wrote the middle half. I wrote the rest. I'm not a good writer. It
			also wrote the two sentences before this one.
